Consolidated List of all the charts (Plotly Express)


This Notebook will help in quick reference while doing EDA ...

Overview The plotly.express module (usually imported as px) contains functions that can create entire figures at once, and is referred to as Plotly Express or PX. Plotly Express is a built-in part of the plotly library, and is the recommended starting point for creating most common figures. Every Plotly Express function uses graph objects internally and returns a plotly.graph_objects.Figure instance. Throughout the plotly documentation, you will find the Plotly Express way of building figures at the top of any applicable page, followed by a section on how to use graph objects to build similar figures. Any figure created in a single function call with Plotly Express could be created using graph objects alone, but with between 5 and 100 times more code.

Plotly Express provides more than 30 functions for creating different types of figures. The API for these functions was carefully designed to be as consistent and easy to learn as possible, making it easy to switch from a scatter plot to a bar chart to a histogram to a sunburst chart throughout a data exploration session. Scroll down for a gallery of Plotly Express plots, each made in a single function call.

Plotly Express currently includes the following functions:

Basics: scatter, line, area, bar, funnel, timeline

Part-of-Whole: pie, sunburst, treemap, funnel_area

1D Distributions: histogram, box, violin, strip

2D Distributions: density_heatmap, density_contour

Matrix Input: imshow

3-Dimensional: scatter_3d, line_3d

Multidimensional: scatter_matrix, parallel_coordinates, parallel_categories

Tile Maps: scatter_mapbox, line_mapbox, choropleth_mapbox, density_mapbox

Outline Maps: scatter_geo, line_geo, choropleth

Polar Charts: scatter_polar, line_polar, bar_polar

Ternary Charts: scatter_ternary, line_ternary
